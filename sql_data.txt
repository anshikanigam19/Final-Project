      <p>Cybercriminals often target small businesses because they typically have weaker security measures compared to larger corporations but still possess valuable data.</p>
      <h2>Essential Security Measures</h2>
      <h3>1. Use Strong, Unique Passwords</h3>
      <p>Implement a password policy that requires employees to use strong, unique passwords for all business accounts. Consider using a password manager.</p>
      <h3>2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication</h3>
      <p>Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification beyond just a password.</p>
      <h3>3. Regular Software Updates</h3>
      <p>Keep all software, including operating systems and applications, updated with the latest security patches.</p>
      <h3>4. Employee Training</h3>
      <p>Educate employees about phishing attacks, safe browsing habits, and how to identify potential security threats.</p>',
